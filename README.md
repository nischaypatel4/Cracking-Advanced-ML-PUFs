# Project Overview

1) Designed and implemented a custom feature extraction pipeline that transforms 8-bit ML-PUF challenges into high-dimensional representations for accurate linear model prediction.

2) Developed and optimized linear model training to achieve 100% test accuracy with a training time of order 10ˆ-18 sec.

3) Built and tested an arbiter PUF inversion algorithm to recover 256 non-negative delays from a 65-dimensional model with Euclidean reconstruction error of 10ˆ-18.
